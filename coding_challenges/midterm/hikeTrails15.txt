  Description:
    Abstract: Locations of recreational trails in State Parks and Management Areas mapped for informational and planning purposes. Only trails occuring within State of Rhode Island properties are included in these data. All trails on properties owned by land trusts, towns, private organizations, or organizations such as The Nature Conservancy are not included. There are portions of the North South trail included in these data that do not occur on state lands, however for the full North South Trail, please reference the NSTrail15 dataset also on RIGIS.
    Purpose: General reference for planning purposes and small scale cartographic output. It is important for users to note that this may not be a complete piture of all trails on state-owned land.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: New fields added to dataset, including Mgt_Area, Comments, and Length_Mi. Field Calculator was used to populate the Length_Mi field. The Mgt_Area field was populated using the "staCons14" (State Conservation Lands)data that can be found on RIGIS under the Environment & Conservation data category. By utilizing the names of the conservation areas, it was possible to select the trails occuring within these polygons and populate the appropriate management area or state park name. The Universal Access dataset was then merged to the trails dataset. The comments field contains information indicating universal accessibility, trail name or other relevant information. Not all trail names are present in the dataset at this time.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Arcadia trails cleaned up. Original Arcadia trails mapped in 1998 without differential correction. Edited trails in this area to remove "tangles," overshoots, undershoots, dangles and other errors. All trails reviewed to ensure all non-state owned trails removed.
