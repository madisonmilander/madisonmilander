    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Property boundary delineations were derived from a variety of sources including:
        Municipal Tax Assessors data in GIS format
        Scanned and Georegistered Paper Tax Assessors Maps
        Digital and/or Scanned and Georegistered Survey Documents
        Hand drawn sketches
        Attributes were drawn from:
        Tax Assessors on-line sources
        Visits with local Planners & Tax Assessors and with the responsible land conservation organizations.
        All data was reviewed for accuracy by local sources.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: Data contributed to RIGIS by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. Metadata were reviewed, corrections made to formatting, RIGIS distribution information added.
