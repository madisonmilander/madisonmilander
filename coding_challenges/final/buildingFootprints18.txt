  Description:
    Abstract: Representative, computer generated building footprints for Rhode Island.  Originally developed by Microsoft, these data were released by Microsoft as open source data in June 2018.
    Purpose: Representative building footprints appropriate for use as general reference.  This not a comprehensive dataset representing all structures in Rhode Island.

      "The building extraction is done in two stages:
      1) Semantic Segmentation – Recognizing building pixels on the aerial image using DNNs
      2) Polygonization – Converting building pixel blobs into polygons

      First Stage - Semantic Segmentation

      DNN architecture
      The network foundation is ResNet34 which can be found here (https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/blob/master/PretrainedModels/Image.md#resnet). In order to produce pixel prediction output, we have appended RefineNet upsampling layers described in this paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06612). The model is fully-convolutional, meaning that the model can be applied on an image of any size (constrained by GPU memory, 4096x4096 in our case).

      Training details
      The training set consists of 5 million labeled images. Majority of the satellite images cover diverse residential areas in US. For the sake of good set representation, we have enriched the set with samples from various areas covering mountains, glaciers, forests, deserts, beaches, coasts, etc. Images in the set are of 256x256 pixel size with 1 ft/pixel resolution. The training is done with CNTK toolkit using 32 GPUs.

      Metrics
      These are the intermediate stage metrics we use to track DNN model improvements and they are pixel based. The pixel error on the evaluation set is 1.15%. Pixel recall/precision = 94.5%/94.5%

      Second Stage - Polygonization

      Method description
      We developed a method that approximates the prediction pixels into polygons making decisions based on the whole prediction feature space. This is very different from standard approaches, e.g. Douglas-Peucker algorithm, which are greedy in nature. The method tries to impose some of a priory building properties, which are, at the moment, manually defined and automatically tuned. Some of these a priori properties are:

      The building edge must be of at least some length, both relative and absolute, e.g. 3 meters
      Consecutive edge angles are likely to be 90 degrees
      Consecutive angles cannot be very sharp, smaller by some auto-tuned threshold, e.g. 30 degrees
      Building angles likely have very few dominant angles, meaning all building edges are forming angle of (dominant angle ± nπ/2)
      In near future, we will be looking to deduce this automatically from existing building information.

      Metrics
      Building matching metrics:

      Metric	Value
      Precision 99.3%
      Recall	93.5%

      We track various metrics to measure the quality of the output:

      Intersection over Union – This is the standard metric measuring the overlap quality against the labels
      Shape distance – With this metric we measure the polygon outline similarity
      Dominant angle rotation error – This measures the polygon rotation deviation

      On our evaluation set contains ~15k building. The metrics on the set are:

      IoU is 0.85, Shape distance is 0.33, Average rotation error is 1.6 degrees
      The metrics are better or similar compared to OSM building metrics against the labels
      Data Vintage
      The vintage of the footprints depends on the vintage of the underlying imagery. Because Bing Imagery is a composite of multiple sources it is difficult to know the exact dates for individual pieces of data.

      How good are the data?
      Our metrics show that in the vast majority of cases the quality is at least as good as data hand digitized buildings in OpenStreetMap. It is not perfect, particularly in dense urban areas but it is still awesome."

        Opened the original source geojson file using QGIS version 3.2.0-Bonn, then exported to Esri shapefile format.  Using ArcGIS Desktop 10.6, re-projected the resulting shapefile to RI state plane (EPSG: 3438); used the "NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_5" geographic transformation, did not select the "preserve shape" option.  Wrote metadata and made available for distribution via RIGIS.
